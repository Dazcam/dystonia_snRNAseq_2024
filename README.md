## Dystonia project - Kathryn Peall

## Regions of interest
  + Striatum (Merge Caudate and Putamen)
  + Cerebellum
  + Frontal Cortex

## Method

1. Download Stiletti scRNAseq data for adult brain regions
2. QC data and generate clusters using Seurat
3. Label adult cell types
4. Generate GeX violin plots for adult and fetal brain (latter from Biol Psych paper)
5. Aggregate expression for all distinct cell types (adult and fetal) and choose
a visualisation method to easily identify patterns of expression across regions

<summary>Benchmarking for hdWGCNA Slurm</summary>

Again problems with FCX in particular. Main problem is 
transposing the count matrix at the start of the script.

Tried close to max resources on the HTC cluster:

- Settings: `threads = 24, mem_mb = 240000, -p highmem`
- Fail: OOM

```bash
Job ID: 58052149
Cluster: hawk
User/Group: c.c1477909/c.c1477909
State: OUT_OF_MEMORY (exit code 0)

Job Wall-clock time: 02:42:58
Memory Utilized: 206.46 GB
Memory Efficiency: 88.09% of 234.38 GB
```

Tried to run it on the `highmem` partition, but even
approaching the absolute resource limits for that:

- Settings: `threads = 20, mem_mb = 300000, -p highmem`
- Fail: OOM

```bash
Job ID: 58057393
Cluster: hawk
User/Group: c.c1477909/c.c1477909

```

- Settings: `threads = 20, mem_mb = 350000, -p highmem`
- Fail: (exit code 1)

```bash
Job ID: 58100400

Job Wall-clock time: 02:59:52
Memory Utilized: 310.64 GB
Memory Efficiency: 90.89% of 341.80 GB
```

In this run R threw the following error:

```r
Error in mcfork() : 
  unable to fork, possible reason: Cannot allocate memory
```

This was due to the threads allocation in the R script (40) 
not matching that set by snakemake (20). The run passed the
point it usually fails at, so next run with same reosurces 
may complete.
